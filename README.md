# Memcached

A fork of the `Memcached` framework to be used as a dependency in [ba-st](https://github.com/ba-st)
for GS/64.

The `upstream` branch is supposed to track the changes in
the main branch of [svenvc/memcached](https://github.com/svenvc/memcached).

The `release-candidate` is the branch where our changes land before releasing a version.

A client for Memcached, a distributed memory caching system.

"
A MDDecrementCommand is a command that decrements a variable on the server.

Note that underflow in the ""decr"" command is caught: if a client tries
to decrease the value below 0, the new value will be 0.

Note also that decrementing a number such that it loses length isn't
guaranteed to decrement its returned length.  The number MAY be
space-padded at the end, but this is purely an implementation
optimization, so you also shouldn't rely on that.
